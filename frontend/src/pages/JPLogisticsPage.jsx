            JP Logistics faced several challenges in its existing online
            presence. Their previous website lacked modern design aesthetics,
            user-friendly navigation, and interactive features. Additionally,
            the absence of a robust content management system hindered the
            client’s ability to update and showcase their evolving services
            effectively.

            builder. This combination allowed for a highly customizable and
            responsive website, meeting the client’s unique requirements.
